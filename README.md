## Description

An arcade game clone built using Javascript OOP concepts.  This is project
number 3 for [Udacity's](https://www.udacity.com/) Front-End Nanodegree (FEND) Program.

Dependencies include:
  * [Animate CSS](https://daneden.github.io/animate.css/)

## Instructions

Download this repo and load the index.html file in a web browser.

Move your player with the arrow keys (up, down, left, right) up toward the
river (blue row of tiles). If you make it to the river you score a point and
are put back in the starting position. If your player collides with a bug, you
lose a life and are put back in the starting position.  

After losing three lives the game is over and you will be shown your final score
along with a chance to play again.

You can also change your player sprite by choosing another from the list.
